* Python Version: 3.8.3
* Editors: VIM 8.1.2269, VSCode 1.6.1, Atom 1.58.0

    ```
3. Run the console:
    ```bash

## 0x04. Testing
All tests are defined in the `tests` folder. Python unit tests are organized in the following manner:
* Modules: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`
* Classes: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`
* Functions (inside and outside a class): `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`

To run the tests in interactive mode:
```bash
echo "python3 -m unittest discover tests" | bash

To run the tests in non-interactive mode:

python3 -m unittest discover tests

## 0x05. Usage
